# STA207-project - Analysis on Factors Affecting the Confirmed Cases Amount of COVID-19

Language being used: R studio

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious desease caused by SARS-CoV-2. The main symptoms for COVID-19 are fever, cough, difficulty breathing, fatigue and diarrhea with an incubation period between 1 to 14 days. According to World Health Organization, there have been 452,201,564 confirmed cases including 6,029,852 deaths of COVID-19 since this pandemic started as of March 13 2022. Since around 1/3 of infected person are asymptomatic carrier, it would be really difficult for government and people to be prepared and free from infection. Therefore, researchers are dedicated to find significant factors to the amount of confirmed cases for each country.

This project would contained a comprehensive data preprocessing to tidy the data set, including selecting useful data, handling missing values and split groups of each factor. A two-way ANOVA model would be used to mainly investigate the influence of two factors: human development degree and population density affecting the number of confirmed cases among the whole world. Exploratory data analysis is conducted to better understand the data, such as the distributions and level differences. After that, the ANOVA model has been constructed, investigated and evaluated.

As a result, the significant factor level has been tested and selected. Also, further discussions are made for the models, dataset, and the entire analysis process at the end of this project.
