# Analysis on Factors Affecting the Confirmed Cases Amount of COVID-19

## University of California, Davis STA207 project 

### Language being used: R studio

This project shows an analysis on influence of different human development degree and population density level on the growth of COVID-19 new cases using two-way ANOVA model. 

It would contained a comprehensive data preprocessing to tidy the data set, including selecting useful data, handling missing values and split groups of each factor. A two-way ANOVA model would be used to mainly investigate the influence of two factors: human development degree and population density affecting the number of confirmed cases among the whole world. Exploratory data analysis is conducted to better understand the data, such as the distributions and level differences. After that, the ANOVA model has been constructed, investigated and evaluated.

As a result, the significant factor level has been tested and selected. Also, further discussions are made for the models, dataset, and the entire analysis process at the end of this project.
